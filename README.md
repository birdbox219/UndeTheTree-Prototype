# 🌲 Under the Tree

> **A mechanically driven platformer about duality, pressure, and survival.**

**Under the Tree** is a 2D vertical platformer set inside a colossal, ancient, and burning tree. The game challenges players to climb upward while sharing control between two souls bound to a single body. The core of the experience is not combat or spectacle—it is **choice under stress**.

---

## 🎮 Core Hook

You control two characters in one body, each with distinct movement abilities. Progress depends on switching between them in real-time, often mid-action, to overcome environmental challenges while an ever-rising fire applies constant pressure.

### The Duality System
*   **Saleem (Momentum):** Fast and agile. Excels at horizontal traversal and maintaining speed.
*   **Salma (Precision):** Controlled and resilient. Capable of higher vertical reach through a double jump.

The player is never asked to be perfect—only to choose wisely.

## 🔥 Key Features

*   **Mechanical Storytelling:** Narrative is conveyed through gameplay mechanics rather than exposition.
*   **Pressure-Driven Progression:** The "Fire Danger" system acts as a systemic force, influencing pacing, visuals, and audio intensity.
*   **Procedural Replayability:** Features handcrafted opening and ending sequences, with procedurally generated mid-sections to ensure no two climbs are identical.
*   **Immersive Atmosphere:** Restrained UI and minimalist dark fantasy visuals ensure the player stays focused on the environment.

## 🧱 Gameplay Structure

The game is built around vertical progression within a single, massive environment.

**Platform Archetypes:**
*   **Normal:** For planning and recovery.
*   **Moving:** Testing timing and momentum conservation.
*   **Timed/Falling:** Demanding commitment and risk assessment.

**Design Philosophy:**
*   Flow > Precision
*   Decision-making > Reflexes
*   Fair Challenge > Punishment

## 🛠️ Technical Foundation

*Developed in Unity (C#)*

This project serves as a robust prototype demonstrating mechanical feasibility and architectural discipline. Key technical implementations include:

*   **Custom Dual-State Controller:** Seamless runtime character switching with state preservation.
*   **Event-Driven Systems:** Decoupled gameplay logic (GameManager, Sensors, UI) for modularity.
*   **Procedural Level Generation:** An object-pooling system that assembles level segments dynamically.
*   **Reactive VFX/SFX:** Post-processing and audio layers that react in real-time to the "Fire Pressure" values.

---

## 🚀 Vision

**Under the Tree** is conceived as the first entry in a broader universe. Future iterations are planned to explore:
*   Expanded narrative themes and deeper character exploration.
*   3D adaptations of the core vertical mechanics.
*   Parkour extensions and combat integration.

The franchise is built to grow organically from its mechanics, not from lore dumps.
